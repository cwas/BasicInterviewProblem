# Basic Interview Problem  

Greetings and salutations.  The following is a basic exercise that the Mobile Apps Team uses to help us interview bright and talented developers like you!  This project includes the framework for a simple map-based android application.  Once we have a functioning shell of an application up and running, we will ask you to perform a few changes to add some basic behavior of the application.  Once you're done, we'd love to see your code!  

Lets get started!  

Step 1: Install Android Studio.  I used version: 1.0.  

Step 2: Download the code onto your machine using git. Something like:
````
git clone https://github.com/travisbaumgart/BasicInterviewProblem.git" 
````

Step 3: Import the git project into Android Studio.  A few users have had to upgrade Gradle in order to get the project building.  Android Studio SHOULD help you with this.  Take a look at the application structure.  Like most IDEs, Android Studio hides a lot of the dirty details from us so that we can just concentrate on the task at hand.

Step 4:  Let's get the app building and deployed to a phone.  If you don't have a phone, feel free to use the Emulator that comes with Android Studio.  The phone is faster/easier.  You've been warned!  First make sure your phone is in Development Mode.  This will allow Android Studio to deploy your app.  Not sure how to put your phone into Development Mode?  I could google that for you...but I WON'T!  Once you're ready...use Android Studio to publish the app.  

Step 5:  Houston...we have a problem.  Your map is probably not showing up.  Our goal was something like:

Here is your first challenge.  Let's fix the app so that we can see the map.  Open up the file called 
google_maps_api.xml.  You need a Google Maps API key.  Follow the instructions in the comments at the top of this file.  See if you can't get the map to show up.
